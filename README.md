# Above The Line: Translanguager's Companion

An advanced tool for exploring texts. Generate detailed grammatical annotations for any text using the Gemini API. This app was created by Dominik Lukeš in Google AI Studio and is powered by the Gemini API. It is designed as a comprehensive suite of tools for students, educators, and language enthusiasts to explore texts and video transcripts in depth.

## Core Features

- **Detailed Text & Video Annotation:** Paste any text or a timecoded video transcript to generate line-by-line analysis. The app provides word-for-word translations, detailed grammatical information, and natural-sounding idiomatic translations for each line.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Slideshow:** For annotations without a video source, the slideshow can generate high-quality audio for each slide, turning your text into an engaging listening experience with full playback controls.
- **Multiple Interaction Modes:** Go beyond static text with three dynamic modes designed for different learning styles: a focused **Deep Read** view, a multimedia **Slideshow** mode for syncing text with video, and an interactive **Study Mode** to gamify your learning.
- **Progress Tracking & Gamification:** Turn your annotations into practice sessions. Study Mode tracks your score, time, and progress, helping you identify areas for improvement.
- **Flexible Data Management:** Save your work to your browser, export everything for backup, or share with others. You can export individual annotations as JSON or PDF, and even export stanzas as PNG images.
